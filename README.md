# Brillouin_Zones_Integer_Lattices_Perturbations

We study the k-th Brillouin zone of a point in a locally finite set which is the region in which the point
is the k-closest in the set. If the set is a lattice, the k-th Brillouin zones of different points are
translations of each other, which tile space.

Using lattice.py we create the edges and points related to Brillouin Zones. They are created by drawing the perpendicular bisectors of any 2 points of the lattice.
In our paper "Brillouin Zones of Integer Lattices and Their
Perturbations" We study characteristics of perturbed lattices as well. Here is an example:

Using dcel.py faces, the number of regions, areas, and angles are explored. We assign order values to each face created in the Brillouin zone.
